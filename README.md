# MrRChat

I created this chat program to get more familiar with Java. It is heavily based on ChernoChat by Yan Chernikov (TheCherno). </br>
I have made several changes in front-end design and added several contents to the application. </br>
The UI for chat application is inspired by the USA Network show 'Mr.Robot'.

## ChernoChat

This is the repository [link](https://github.com/TheCherno/ChernoChat) that this application is based on.

## Mr.Robot IRC

This chat application UI is inspired by Mr.Robot's IRC
